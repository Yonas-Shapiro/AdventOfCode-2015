These are the instructions on how to use this copied

This repository has been orgainised into four folders:
- Days 1-9
- Days 10-19
- Days 20-25
- Inputs

The first three are public, but the third one is kept private as to keep the Advent of Code inputs secret.
To run each file as-is, make a text file called "DayXX.txt" in the inputs folder.
Otherwise, rewrite the file pathway. It should always be at the top of the file.

This has been a fun journey,
